## About
Bloom is a task manager mobile application made specifically for indoor plant management.

After the beginning of the pandemic there has been an increase in people pursuing indoor gardening as a new hobby. With that comes also the need to be able to manage your daily tasks and now keep up with plant care. Bloom will act as a centralized hub on your mobile device for your plant care information, reminding you when your plants need their next watering or fertilization.
This mobile application will allow you to take away the stress of managing your plants and allow you to focus on other aspects of your busy life. Unlike its competitors, Bloom will not be blocked off by a paywall allowing you to use its task management features without breaking your bank.
